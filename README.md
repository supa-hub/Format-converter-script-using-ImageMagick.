# Format converter script using ImageMagick.

## Description
This is a simple script that goes through your folder and searches for the pictures of the given format. After that it <br /> 
uses the ImageMagick command tool to convert them into the user's specified format.  <br />

This makes it possible for to store more efficient image formats on your phone, but to easily convert them when storing them on your computer. <br />

After ImageMagick has converted all the files, the script moves them into a folder named "converted_files", <br />
this folder is usually created in the same folder that the original pictures were. <br />
If the folder already exists, the code created the folder into the scripts parent folder. <br /> <br />

NOTE: the script prints out the converted picture folder path into the terminal. <br /> <br />

All the libraries used in the code are part of the python's standard library. <br /> <br />
